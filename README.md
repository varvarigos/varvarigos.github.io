## About Me
I am a 1st-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University, advised by Prof. Leandros Tassiulas. My research interests lie in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), with a focus on their applications in Networked Systems.

I completed my MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EIE) at Imperial College London, where I worked with Prof. Krystian Mikolajczyk on video reconstruction from semantic segmentation using Diffusion Models for my Final Year Project.

## Research Interests
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Deep Learning for Networked Systems
- Computer Vision
